# JavaScript Calculator
A JavaScript calculator is a program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

### How it works
When a user enters numbers and selects an operation, the JavaScript code retrieves the values and performs the selected operation.
The result is then displayed to the user on the web page.
